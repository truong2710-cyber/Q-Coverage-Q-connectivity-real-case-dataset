# Q-Coverage-Q-connectivity-real-case-dataset
This repo contains the real case dataset for the paper "Node placement optimization under Q-Coverage and Q-Connectivity constraints in wireless sensor networks"

The dataset contains the location of 43 targets which are public transport terminals in the center of Hanoi (the capital of Vietnam). There are two json files which are the data for two scenarios:
- Scenario 1: Low q for all of the targets with q_max = 2
- Scenario 2: High q for all of the targets with q_max = 5

The original coordinates are retrieved from ... We then rescale the coordinate to fit them in the range [1000, 1000].
